@property {Object} can-query-logic.EMPTY EMPTY
@parent can-query-logic.static-types

Represents the empty set.

@type {Object} The `QueryLogic.EMPTY` value represents
the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set). It is used to represent a
set that can have no elements. For example, the intersection between `LessThan(5)`
and `GreaterThan(6)` is `EMPTY` because there are no values that can satisfy both conditions.
